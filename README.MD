# This is our raspberry pi 3b project where we experiment with a self-driving robot! ðŸ¤–
- [ ] Update readme with the MosCoW model
- [X] Set up openCV
- [ ] Recognize something. Anything really.
- [ ] Combine the streamhosting script with the engine propulsion script and the openCV script
- [X] Backup the SD card after installing openCV!
- [X] Check if openCV still works after backing up
- [X] Improve steering (forwardleft, rotate with 1 wheel forward, 1 back, different speeds for each wheel)
- [ ] Make a wiring scheme
- [ ] Send audio through softPWM possibly using pigpio to free up the PWM channels for the DC engines
- [ ] Turns out some of the code examples I used are not Python 3 -> port code to Python 3
- [X] Write audio support
- [X] Update the timezone and locale setting using the baic Pi config
- [X] Write a first python program, push it to github and pull it on the Pi
- [X] Set up a bash script that pulls new code from Github and reboots the Python program and can be triggered remotely and makes everything better
- [X] Connect a breadboard and read/write with a basic sensor + LED
- [X] Research balancing robot (2 wheels)
- [X] Jelle makes a first code commit
- [X] Order better gyro/acc. 
- [X] Migrate all documentation to google drive folder
- [X] Run the DC engine using a python script
- [X] Remotely control the DC engine
- [X] Read the acc. chip
- [X] Write a controller cript for each of the robots wheels
- [X] Set up the rPi camera
- [X] Stream the rPi camera through SSH
